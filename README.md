## Project Description

I'm on the process of finding my first job as a front end web developer. This project was made with the intention of showcasing my abilities in this area. I choose a calm set of colors that I could mix with images of stars, galaxies and planets, as I've never seen that before and I think it looks really cool. Plus it's how software developing makes me feel like.

If I had to think of a word that describes my approach to this project is **intentional**. I always take user experience into account when developing something and this project was not an exception. I made sure to create an ecosystem where recruiters could travel between my resume, GitHub, LinkedIn and this portfolio on 1 click. 
I made links on the navbar that would take you anywhere you would want to go and made sure to add a translation button so both english and spanish speakers could see what I can do.

### What I used

1. CSS
2. JavaScript
3. React
4. MaterialUI
5. React-i18next

## Features
1. Language switch between english and spanish
2. It's responsive
3. Links that make you scroll to that particular section of the webpage
4. With UX in mind, developed in a way that makes travelling between my resume to and from GitHub, LinkedIn an this portfolio really easy.
5. Special buttons to download my resume from here
6. A form that establishes a way of communicating with me from this webpage.


## What I learned

1. MaterialUI
    - How to use the sx prop to change the style from the component
    - How to use the Alert component
2. AOS

3. React-i18next
    - How to use i18next, react-i18next and i18next-http-backend to change translate the webpage, alternate between those languages and store those changes con cookies
